### Notes:

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Before running the application, ensure that your PostgreSQL database is set up correctly with the necessary tables. Run the `schema.sql` file to create the tables and the `seeds.sql` file to populate them with initial data.
   - Example commands to run these scripts:

     ```bash
     \i db/schema.sql
     \i db/seeds.sql
     ```

     *Replace `postgres` with your PostgreSQL username if different.*

2. **Environment Variables:**
   - Make sure your `.env` file matches the variable names used in your `server.js` and `queries.js`. The example above uses `PG_` prefixes, which align with the PostgreSQL configuration.

3. **Walkthrough Video:**
   - https://www.loom.com/share/2012e2e700f54c959ce08e651576b244?sid=584a88c7-7a78-4e6d-8af1-292a7f34149e

4. **Dependencies:**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed as per the Installation instructions. This includes `pg`, `inquirer`, `console.table`, and `dotenv`.

5. **Running the Application:**
   - After setting up the database and configuring your environment variables, start the application using:

     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```

   - Follow the on-screen prompts to interact with the Employee Tracker.

6. **License:**
   - Ensure you have a `LICENSE` file in your repository if you mention it in the README.

### Final Checklist:

- [x] **Database Tables Exist:** Ensure `departments`, `roles`, and `employees` tables are created in your PostgreSQL database.
- [x] **Environment Variables Configured:** `.env` file contains correct PostgreSQL credentials.
- [x] **Dependencies Installed:** Run `npm install` and `npm install inquirer@8.2.4`.
- [x] **Database Seeded:** Run `schema.sql` and `seeds.sql` to set up the database.
- [x] **README Updated:** All sections are properly formatted and accurate.
- [x] **Walkthrough Video Linked:** Update the video link in the README.
